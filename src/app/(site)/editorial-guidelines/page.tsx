            At Bloxodes.com, our commitment is to deliver clear, accurate, and trustworthy information to Roblox players worldwide. Our
            editorial guidelines explain how we research, write, review, and update content. These rules ensure that every article and code
            list you read on our site meets the highest standards of accuracy, transparency, and fairness.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground sm:text-3xl">Accuracy and Verification</h2>
          <p>
            We understand that Roblox players rely on our site to find working codes that provide in-game rewards. For this reason, accuracy
            is at the core of our editorial standards. Every active code published on Bloxodes.com is verified against reliable sources such
            as official Roblox developer announcements, verified Discord servers, or game-specific social media accounts like Twitter/X. In
            cases where a code may be unconfirmed, uncertain, or potentially expired, we place it in a <strong>“Check”</strong> category with
            clear labeling so readers know to test it in-game before relying on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Expired codes are not removed entirely but instead moved to a dedicated section. This way, players can confirm for themselves
            whether an old code might still work and can also keep track of past releases.

        <section className="space-y-4">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground sm:text-3xl">Transparency With Readers</h2>
          <p>
            We are transparent in how we create content. Every codes page displays a <strong>“Last Updated”</strong> date so readers know
            when the information was last checked. This helps players judge whether a page reflects the most recent changes in their favorite
            Roblox game.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not exaggerate rewards, mislead players about game benefits, or include fabricated content. If we ever cover sponsored
            material, it will be clearly disclosed to maintain honesty with our readers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bloxodes.com operates independently and is not affiliated with Roblox Corporation or any specific game developers. We do not
            accept payment in exchange for featuring or prioritizing codes. Our editorial decisions are based solely on what is best for
            players seeking accurate and timely information.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we cite sources, such as official Discord channels or developer Twitter/X accounts, we do so to give credit where it is due
            and to maintain accountability. This also helps our readers understand the origin of the information they see.

          <p>
            Our content is written for Roblox players of all ages, so clarity is essential. We use simple and direct language so that both
            new and experienced players can quickly understand how to redeem codes and claim rewards. Step-by-step instructions are provided
            wherever possible, particularly in our <strong>“How to Redeem”</strong> sections, and troubleshooting tips are included when
            players commonly face issues.
          </p>
          <p>Code pages follow a consistent structure across the site:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6">

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground sm:text-3xl">Regular Updates</h2>
          <p>
            Roblox codes change frequently, and players expect us to stay ahead. To meet this expectation, our editors use both manual checks
            and automated monitoring tools to track new code releases and expired ones. We aim to update each codes page as quickly as
            possible, often within hours of a new code dropping. Outdated or broken pages are promptly corrected or improved.
